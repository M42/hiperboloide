Parallel Lines
Herein lies the crux of hyperbolic geometry.<br>All axioms of Euclidean geometry <b><i>except the parallel axiom</i></b> apply in hyperbolic geometry. The Euclidean geometry parallel axiom states:<q>Given a line, AB, and a point C not on that line, there is one and only one line which contains the point C, and is parallel to AB.</q>By contrast, the parallel axiom in hyperbolic geometry is: <q>Given a line AB and a point C not on that line, there are at least two distinct lines which contain C, and are parallel to AB.</q>When thinking about this, keep in mind the strict geometric definitions:<ul><li><em>Parallel lines</em> are lines in a plane which do not intersect.</li><li>A <em>line</em> is a straight path that has no thickness and is endless in both directions.</li></ul> When looking at the construction, it might seem there are a few problems with calling AB, DC and EC lines: 1) they do not look straight and 2) they do not seem endless. However, when viewing objects in the disk model, keep in mind that: <ol><li>The lines look curved because you are viewing them from outside the model. If you were inside a hyperbolic space, then light traveling from A to B would follow the path drawn from A to B. If you were in the hyperbolic space, the hyperbolic lines would look (and be) straight.</li><li> The edge of the disk is infinitely far from every point within the disk.</li></ol> The overall effect of the nature of parallel lines is that any theorm that can be proved in Euclidean geometry without using the parallel axiom will also be a theorm in hyperbolic geometry. Contrariwise, many Euclidean geometry theorms that depends on the parallel axiom will be false in hyperbolic geometry.
