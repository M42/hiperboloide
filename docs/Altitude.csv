Altitudes of a Triangle
The accompanying construction shows &#8710;ABC with altitude AT perpendicular to base BC. Notice that m&ang;ATB and m&ang;ATC are both 90&deg; (as displayed in the orange "Measurements and Modifications" panel).<br><br><em>Your Tasks</em>:<ol><li> Construct the triangle's other two altitudes.</li><li> In Euclidean geometry, the three altitudes of a triangle are coincident (they all intersect at a single point). This point is called the orthocenter of the triangle. Either convince yourself that this is also true in hyperbolic geometry or find a counter example.</li><li>In Euclidean geometry, the area of a triangle is given by the equation: A=&frac12;bh, where the base, b, is the length of any side of the triangle and the height, h, is the distance along the altitude from the chosen base to  the vertex opposite that base. In hyperbolic geometry, this equation results in a contradiction. Find the contradiction and explain it.</li></ol><br> <em>Hint:</em> The following steps were used to construct the altitude AT:<ol><li>Let side BC be the base. Extend segment BC by constructing the line BC.</li><li>Construct &#8857;AX (the circle with center at A that passes through X) where X is any point outside the triangle, so that the &#8857;AX intersects line BC in two places.</li><li>Construct the intersection points of &#8857;AX and line BC. Label these intersection points P and Q. Then, hide circle &#8857;AX, and point X.</li><li>Construct &#8857;PQ and &#8857;QP.</li><li>Construct the intersection points of &#8857;PQ and &#8857;QP. Label these intersection points R and S where S is the intersection farther from A.</li><li>Construct the line AS (which will pass through R). Line AS &perp; BC (why?). Hide &#8857;PQ, &#8857;QP, point P, point Q, and point R.</li><li>Construct the intersection of line CB with line AS. Label this intersection point T and hide point S. Segment AT is the altitude to side BC of &#8710;ABC.</li></ol>
