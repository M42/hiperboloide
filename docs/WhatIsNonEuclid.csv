What is Non-Euclidean Geometry?
In ancient Greece, the mathematician Euclid wrote a textbook on geometry titled "<i>The Elements</i>". The textbook begins with a small set of intuitively appealing assumptions, then uses deduction to develop many propositions. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive logical system. Many of the propositions developed in <i>The Elements</i> are currently taught in secondary school around the world as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. For example, Euclid's Proposition #27 could be translated:<q>If two lines are crossed by a third line such that the alternate interior angles are congruent, then the two lines must be parallel.</q> This statement is then followed by a formal explanation that relies only on the original set of assumptions and Euclid's propositions #1 through #26.<br><br> For more than two thousand years, the prevailing scholarly thought was that no contradictory logical system could be conceived. It was not until the early 19th century that the first fully self-consistent, yet different geometry was developed. This first <em>non-Euclidean geometry</em> came to be known as <em>hyperbolic geometry</em> and it differs from Euclidian geometry in only one of Euclid's original assumptions: hyperbolic geometry assumes that through a point there exists at least two distinct lines that are both parallel to a third line. Today, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are known.<br><br>When these non-Euclidian geometries were first developed they were of profound philosophical interest, but it seemed oblivious through the success of architectural engineering, surveying and other sciences, that the universe adheres to Euclidian geometry. However, an implication of Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity is that physical space itself varies as a function the local gravitational field from a very slightly curved hyperbolic geometry that is almost indistinguishable from Euclidean to a strongly curved hyperbolic geometry. Euclidean space is a good approximation of our universe only over small distances (small compared to the size of the universe) and only where the gravitational field is week (compared to near the surface of a sun). On Earth, our current instrumentation is insufficiently accurate to distinguish between Euclidian geometry and a hyperbolic geometry with Einstein's predicted amount of curvature. However, current technology can detect the predicted curvature of space in Mercury's Orbit. The planet Mercury is near the sun and thus in a significantly higher gravitational field than the Earth. If measured at three points in its orbit, the triangle formed has very slightly less than 180&deg;!<br><br>NonEuclid uses a particular model of two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, called the Poincar&eacute; disk model. This model has an extremely high level of curvature so it is easy to see it as different from Euclidian geometry. It would not be too inaccurate to think of NonEuclid as being a model of 2D space near the event horizon of a small black hole (that is, if you could stay alive long enough to measure triangles).<br><br> In the accompanying construction, try moving the vertices to make one triangle very large and the other very small. Notice that very large triangles look strange and very small triangles look <i>almost</i> like Euclidian triangles.
