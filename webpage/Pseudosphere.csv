Pseudosphere with Regular Hexagon
<img SRC="SphereSurface.png"> A <em>sphere</em> is a three-dimensional object, yet its surface can be perfectly described by two-dimensional spherical geometry using latitude and longitude as locations and great circles as lines. A <em>pseudosphere</em> is also a three-dimensional object. Its surface can be described by two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. The surface of a sphere is <b><i>smaller</i></b> than the plane: it bends back on itself and is finite, whereas the plane is infinite. A pseudosphere, however, is <b><i>bigger</i></b> than the plane. Both the plane and pseudosphere are infinite, yet the pseudosphere manages to have more room. It could be said that the pseudosphere is <b><i>more intensely infinite</i></b> then the plane.<br><br>Precisely because the pseudosphere is actually bigger than the plane, it is very hard to represent it in the normal Euclidean geometry of our drawings. The Poincar&eacute; model is a special trick for shrinking a pseudosphere to fit inside a circular boundary. Shrinking the pseudosphere to fit into a bounded disk distorts the pseudosphere, but it distorts it in a very careful way. The disk of the Poincar&eacute; model is geometrically equivalent to the pseudosphere. In-other-words, <b><i>any theorem proved in the Poincar&eacute; model, is a theorem in the pseudosphere.</i></b><br><br> In the disk model, all points on the <em>boundary circle</em> are infinity far from any point within the disk. The effect of this shrinking can be seen in the accompanying construction of a regular hexagon. It was constructed so that no matter how points A and B are moved, all 6 sides of the hexagon will always have have equal length, yet a side that is nearer the boundary circle appears shorter.<br><br><img SRC="pseudosphere.png"> Although it is impossible to smoothly stretch out the whole pseudosphere in our space, we can stretch out pieces of it. By thinking about what happens if we stretch pieces of the pseudosphere out to proper size, we begin to get an idea of the full surface. These figures do just that. They were drawn by David Povilaitis and excerpted from Rudy Rucker's very cool book "<i>The Fourth Dimension</i>" [Rucker-84]. The three disk shaped sectors are of equal radius, but cut from different locations of the pseudosphere. Each stretchs out to form an identical saddle. A Sector of the pseudosphere cut to the boundary stretches into a horn.
